Lichess Bot for the purpose of studying both chess and Deep Learning..


## Info
This Chess Bot will have different styles. 

### Stockfish 1 million positions (Working)
Analyze up to 1 million (but the database has 98 millions) chess positions and find the best move (download link in the repo)

### Deep Learning Chess (too low %)

Deep Learning model that trains on a database of 120 thousand Lichess games in order to learn how to play.
This is working, but the training is veeery slow (more than 5 hours) and for the moment very low accuracy. 

### Match user Elo

I want to add the possibility to change it's power matching opponent's Elo. To do so i'll analyze huge chess datasets in order to filter them based on user Elo, and my chess skills too (i'm 3N otb and 2N otb rapid)


For now it uses Stockfish 1 million positions and, if the position isn't found, it just does a random move.
Working to make it improve!

Feel free to comment, and share your suggestions! :)
