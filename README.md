# ChessBot_Zoe

Lichess Bot for the purpose of studying both chess and Deep Learning..


## Info
This Chess Bot will have different styles. 

### Match user Elo

I want to add the possibility to change it's power matching opponent's Elo. To do so i'll analyze huge chess datasets in order to filter them based on user Elo.

### Deep Learning Chess 

I want to add a Deep Learning model that trains on hundreds of different games in order to improve its style

### Leela

I want to add the possibility to play against Leela engine. 


For now nothing is implemented. It just does random moves.

Feel free to comment, and share your suggestions! :)
